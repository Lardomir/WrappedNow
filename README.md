* **Secure Spotify Login**: Authenticates directly and securely with your Spotify account using the official OAuth flow.
* **Cross-Platform**: Built with Apache Cordova to run on both Android and iOS devices from a single codebase.

*(More features like location and activity-based insights are coming soon!)*

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

* **Framework**: [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)
* **Backend & Database**: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (using Firestore for cloud sync)
* **Authentication**: [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) (Authorization Code Flow with PKCE)
* **Build Tool**: [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for fast JavaScript bundling.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
* [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for the Android SDK and emulator)
* A globally installed Cordova CLI:
    ```bash
    npm install -g cordova
    ```

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [URL_TO_YOUR_REPOSITORY]
    cd wrappednow
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Spotify Credentials:**
    * Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
    * Create an app and copy your **Client ID**.
    * In the app settings, add `ch.example.wrappednow://callback` as a **Redirect URI**.
    * Paste your Client ID into the `spotifyConfig` object in the `src/app.js` file.

4.  **Add the Android Platform:**
    ```bash
    cordova platform add android
    ```
    *(This will also run the hook to apply necessary Gradle fixes).*

### Running the App

1.  **Start the development server:**
    This command will watch for changes in `src/app.js` and automatically rebuild `www/js/bundle.js`.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Run on an Android Emulator:**
    Open a **new terminal window** and run:
    ```bash
    cordova emulate android
    ```
